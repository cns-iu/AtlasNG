# Knowledge Graph Explorer Guidance

- `@atlasng/kg-explorer` is an application library that builds the knowledge-graph explorer experience and may consume shared Angular, design-system, and storybook infrastructure.
- Its `layer:app-library` tag limits imports to the published libraries (`labs` and below). Only `.storybook/` configuration may import `@atlasng/internal/storybook`.
- Keep the public API additive and avoid breaking changes unless explicitly requested.
- When changing behavior, update the relevant unit tests and stories in the same feature area.
- Prefer reusing design-system primitives and internal Storybook theme tokens instead of introducing ad hoc styling.
- Validate with `npx nx test kg-explorer` and `npx nx lint kg-explorer`.
